## How to use

This is my hobby project. You can take a 5 seconds-long web-cam capture while a dancer is dancing with you. You can preview and download the the short video back. The audio is also captured. **Please notice that this web app cannot run well on iOS browsers** since I don't have dancer video with transparent background. But, you can change the video source as you wish in the source code video tag. Since I want to test the logic and I am not a good video editor, I just left the video file part.

Mobile browser can also work. You can access both cameras of your phone or tablet.
